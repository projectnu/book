== Meet the Nu family

It was an ordinary town-house at the end of an ordinary road to the north of an ordinary town. Nothing exceptional happens in this town aptly called *Boreford*, well other than the usual football in which the odds are mostly against the local club, some vandalism here and there which even the Boreford Local doesnâ€™t bother to report. Perhaps this one cycling event for the local charity that attracted many pensioner cyclists and got covered by The Moon newspaper, with a neat map showing the location of Boreford for strangers, of course alongside a story on Brexit.

Mr Nu and his family of three moved here a few years ago when their local international-mortgage agent mis-sold this town and the property as a dream location _only hours from London_! Nu with a strong Asian background aced his interview at a local secondary school and now teaches Mathematics for grade 7 and 8. Mathematics is a field of study that was once popular before they invented iPads. As you know nowadays people ask Siri or her moody sister Alexa for anything and everything including numbers.

Mrs Nu loves watching TV and looking after their home. Her favourite hobby is to _count the Asians_ appearing on TV and share it with their friends back in her country. She once counted 10 in a single day when the camera angle accidentally moved to focus on an Asian group prompting apologies from the Head of Broadcast himself! She believes the number 42 is the answer for the end of life, the universe and everything as we know it.

Master Nu who recently turned ten is nothing like his parents. Quiet an introvert who loves his school and the local football club. Loves his Windows PC, Mathematics and Science, the last two is not by his choice. He loves sharing things and wants to become a teacher like his dad so he could share his knowledge and wisdom with others.
