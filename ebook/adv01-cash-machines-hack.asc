=== Cash machine is not working

"Honey, can I cook your favourite congee with rice and lettuce? You look quite exhausted!" queried Mrs Nu as Mr Nu entered through the door.

"Hmm, sounds yummy. Don’t forget to add the Broccoli and those lovely and fresh green cabbages from Tesco" responded Mr Nu as he tried to remove his over-sized tan boots.

"Mom, you always cook the same and they look and taste the same" murmured Young Nu from his bedroom.

"No way! I made a delicious stew yesterday with spinach, cauliflower, and brown rice. The day before that was the healthy soup with red rice and frozen peas" countered Mrs Nu from the kitchen.

"Nu, don’t talk to your mom like that! Where are you hiding now?" wondered Mr Nu. "Dad, I am in my bedroom. I am now playing Minecraft; I have finished my homework and Numon work".

"Ever since you got him that laptop last year for his birthday he is always playing. How can he become a doctor? Why can’t you get him an iPad like other dads?"

"Darling, computers are good for creativity and learning. No wonder children in this country are losing those skills ever since the tablet sales took off. Plus, a computer is a lot cheaper … did you see the price of that new iPad? Blimey, it’s more expensive than our car!" responded Mr Nu defending his choice of gift.

"Alright, did you bring the cash for the plumber? He is going to come in an hour and he takes only cash".

"No. The cash machine was not working"

"What do you mean no? And what do you mean not working? Can you not do one task properly? Now that plumber is going to shout and shame us in English!". Mrs Nu started panicking.

"Honey, I swear. I tried three different cash machines and they all were out of cash"

"Out of cash? It’s not even Christmas. Who is going to withdraw all the cash in September?" mumbled Mrs Nu unconvinced by Mr Nu’s explanation.

Young Nu was quietly listening to his parents’ arguments. "Well they argue all the time but this one feels different" wondered Young Nu. "Perhaps I should take a look on Twitter. Look! lots of people are complaining about this". Nu scrolled through the never-ending list of moans from the public on Twitter. "It looks like people from other town are also affected. Maybe I should do something. Let’s tell Mom"

"Mommy, can I play Minecraft for a little more time. I will come down in an hour. I promise!"

"Ok, half an hour. We can’t have the congee when it’s cold, can we?"

"Thanks, Mom. Won’t miss the congee"

=== Open the terminal

Young Nu quickly closed the _Minecraft_ game he was about to play. Well, you should be naïve to think that Nu would play a game when there is something unbelievable happening in the country. He quickly opened an application called *Mineterm* on his computer. This application has an icon similar to the game to fool any unsuspecting parents including the Nus.

"We need to first find who or what is withdrawing the cash from all the machine. For this, we are going to hack into Link which is the network that owns and operates them. Think of them as a large Tesco for all cash machine related activities. You can find the transaction data for each bank neatly arranged in the shelf. Understood Teddy?". Nu loves brainstorming with his teddy whom he believes his more intellectually aligned with him.

"Are you going to ask how we are going find the address for Link? Oh, here it is from Wikipedia. It is called "_ssh.link.co.uk_". Computers have a shorter address to make it easy to find them on the internet and that’s what we have found now!"

Next, we need the username for a user who could access this computer. I can see that Tom Pearman is the IT administrator for Link from LinkedIn. So, let’s try tom or root or tpearman, shall we?".

Nu was conversationally teaching his teddy the _art of locating credentials from social media profiles_ the basic skills that are used by ethical hackers and criminals alike.

"We have logged in now thanks to Cooper Tom’s adorable dog. Can you see these pictures on Factbook teddy?". Who might have thought to post your dog’s pictures and labelling them nicely on Factbook is a bad and risky idea?

[WARNING]
====
Always be careful about what you share on the internet even if it is just to your friends. Any information or pictures of you or your family that is shared could fall into the hands of the baddies!

Ask your parents if they use either your name or your dogs name in their password.

"The next step is to locate the *database* that contains all the information. Are you wondering what a database is? A database is a system for storing and retrieving data. It is like an address book or a telephone directory to store a number of records. You can open the database to look for an address or add a new address if needed."

[TIP]
====
Your school might use a range of databases for various purposes such as:

* Storing attendance and grades
* Planning curriculum
* Plan any outdoor activities
====

We need another software called a database client to access the database. It is like an assistant that will make it easy to work with the database.

[TIP]
====
You can download database clients with graphical interfaces for major databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL!
====

Inside the database, data that are similar are grouped and stored in the form of tables. This is similar to how address book contains all addresses and your mom’s recipe book contains you know recipes. You store it this way otherwise it’s nearly pointless like if you store your uncle’s address in the recipe book you are guaranteed to forget it.

Now you write the address one below the other in your address book. In a database table, you store data in rows and columns. Each row contains one information with various columns. For example, the address book table will have one row for your friend’s address and another row for your uncle’s. The addresses will have columns such as Name, Telephone number, Postcode, and even country!

=== DDC News time

Having finished his congee on time to her delight Mr Nu now earned the right to switch the TV channel to his favourite programme – the DDC news at 8!

"We have learned that all the cash machines in the UK have run out of cash due to _some logistical issue_. We urge the public not to panic since the state of our bank and economy are stable. For more on this issue, we turn to our in-house expert …"

[TIP]
====
Television news broadcasts use experts to explain the events. Always watch out for fake and incorrect news on TV and social media!
====

"Honey, see I was not lying, phew. Let me call the plumber and tell him to come tomorrow". Mr Nu was more than relaxed now that the presenter on the TV and possibly the whole country is on his side.

"*Logistical issue*? What a big fat lie teddy!"

"Now let’s open the *transactions table* in our database and see what’s happening for real, shall we?"

To see or view the data in a database table we can either use commands or a graphical application that might look similar to your spreadsheet application like Excel or Numbers. *Commands aka queries* are harder to remember but once you master them, they allow you to work faster. Let me teach the queries.

First, to view the data you use the *select query* like this

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM transactions
----

.Transactions Table
[caption="Two transaction rows and 4 columns including name and location: "]
image::transactions.jpg[Transactions Table]

[sidebar]
.Select query song
--
If you wanna view the data +
You use the SELECT query

If you wanna search the data +
You use the SELECT query
--

As Nu pressed enter after issuing this query, several characters and symbols started flowing on his screen and lit his room bright green!

"Quick, let us kill the query by pressing the escape key. Do you know the mistake I made teddy? There is so much data in this table like several millions of them and I issued a command to view ALL of them!""

"Let’s get a bit specific, shall we? Let’s only look for data that happened only in boreford. To do such filtering you add *WHERE* clause to the SELECT query. Here it is"

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE town = boreford
----

[sidebar]
.Select with Where song
--
If you wanna view the data +
You use the SELECT query +
If the data is too big +
Don’t forget the *WHERE* +
Don’t forget the *WHERE*
--

With a successful use of WHERE along with SELECT the query returned only 5 rows.

"Well done teddy. See, told you queries are easy. Wait a minute. I think I see something …"

Young Nu gazed at the screen without blinking. He wiped his eyes and began staring again. He could not believe what was right in front of him. All the 5 rows returned from the table said the person withdrawing the cash was the *QUEEN*!!!

"Why is the Queen in our town and withdrawing cash from the cash machines? Something doesn’t add up! Let’s run the query again but this time for London and Manchester"

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE town = London OR Manchester
----

They say commands don’t lie. No matter what town Nu tried they all returned the name as QUEEN.

"Surely the Queen cannot be in all the places at once!"

"Ah, unless someone has managed to clone the Queen’s card multiple times and is doing a coordinated theft. Did you know that the Queen carries a "*crown card*" that allows unlimited money withdrawal from any cash machine in the world! That explains everything. I should do something now …".

In an ideal world, the child has to explain their finding to their parents who would then call the affected person who would then call their bank to cancel their stolen card. But this is no ordinary situation and Nu is not an ordinary family. Young Nu has to deal with this situation alone all by himself. The clock is ticking and is a matter of time before the whole world runs out of its money!

<<<

=== Stop before its too late

Young Nu has to pretend to be the Queen to cancel the stolen card. But there is a problem. He is not good at _mimicking the Queen_ and most importantly has no way of calling anyone since there is no mobile phone or even a landline in his house. Mr Nu believes that smartphones are bad for children!

As he kept looking at the information on the screen, thanks to the earlier SELECT query, the answer was right in front of him.

"What if I mark the card as stolen directly in the database? That could block all the future cash withdrawal attempts" he wondered.

[TIP]
====
When a person contacts their bank to cancel their card, the operator would first ask for some _verification information_ from the caller. Then they locate the card in their database and modifies a single column called "_status_" to make it "blocked". They do not have to modify any other column in the row such as name or the number. Only a single column!
====

"Teddy, hope you remember that you use *SELECT* query to find the data in a table. Do you know the query to change or update the data?

It’s called the *UPDATE* query! You have to be a little bit careful though since you might inadvertently update all the data instead of just the one you should.

So, I am going to carefully block the Queen’s card alone like this. Watch me …"

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE cards SET status = blocked
WHERE name = queen
----

[sidebar]
.Update query song
--
If you wanna view the data +
You use the SELECT query

If you wanna change it +
You use the UPDATE query

To change is UPDATE +
To change is UPDATE
--

"Did you see how I carefully used *WHERE* clause to change only the Queen’s card! We don’t want to block all the cards belonging to everyone and cause global chaos, right?"

Well at this point a Hollywood movie might show loud cheers and green lights turning on in a glorious fashion, but this isn’t Hollywood. This is Boreford.

To be honest, Young Nu is perfectly happy not to have any cheers or green light. He is supposedly playing Minecraft remember! At this point, there was another clock ticking which he had completely forgotten about.

"Five more minutes before I come upstairs" reminded Mr Nu. "I can wait longer but the congee won’t!".

"Sure dad. Finishing up the final level. I am trying to _save the world_ here you know!"

"Save the what???"

"Save the GAME!"

"Ok, four and a half minutes to save everything you can"

By blocking the Queen’s card Nu has stopped the hackers from stealing any further cash. But what about all the cash is already withdrawn? If only there is a way of finding the identity of the thieves like a photo or a camera or something like that … Nu’s eyes suddenly started glowing.

"All the cash machines have a camera in them. Photos of the people withdrawing the money are stored in a different database table called *photos*. If I jointly look for the Queen’s transactions and match them up with the photos I can find the exact photo of the real hackers. Teddy, do you know how to match or join the data in two different tables?

You can use the *INNER JOIN* clause along with SELECT query. Here it is"

[source,sql]
----
SELECT photo FROM photos
INNER JOIN transactions ON photos.time = transactions.time
WHERE name = queen
----

"Did you see how I joined and connected two different tables – photos and transactions to find the photos of the culprits?"

[TIP]
====
Database joins are conceptually similar to the set theory in Mathematics!
====

"Nu, one-minute left" warned dad as the news broadcast was about to end.

"Yes, dad. About to transfer some data"

"Transfer WHAT? Don’t make me transfer some whips!"

"No, please. Coming down now"

"Teddy, let’s email the photos to the police and MI5 anonymously using tor"

****
Dear Police and MI5,

Attached are the photos of the criminals who stole the cash with a cloned card belonging to the Queen.


Good luck!

*Your friendly citizen*
****

"All done. Let’s go …"

"Here I come"

"That’s my good boy. Here is your congee with Broccoli. I have warmed up the food again for you"

"Thanks, mom"

It was almost the end of the news broadcast at 8. As the camera moved away from focus, a couple of Asian staff could be seen hurrying towards the presenter and handing over some papers.

"Look! Two more Asians on TV" screamed mum with disbelief.

"We have a last-minute update" announced the news presenter. "The banks have identified the cause of today’s cash machine issues and have promised to sort them out before the morning. Have a good night!"

"That’s reassuring. I will get the cash tomorrow morning" promised dad. "Bedtime now Nu".

"Ok dad finishing my food"

The camera on TV zoomed in on to the paper in the hands of the presenter. The words *Your friendly citizen* was momentarily visible on TV and young Nu didn’t miss it.

"Oh no! What if they find me or even worse tell my dad?" a nervous Nu wondered. He carefully hid his sweat and casually rushed to his bed.

"Dad can I quickly check if I have missed any homework on the school website?"

"Ok, don’t you think it’s too late for that? When are you going to improve your time management skills? I will excuse you this time alone."

"Thanks, Dad."

"Teddy, hope you remember that SELECT query is for viewing and UPDATE query is for changing. Now can you guess the use of INSERT and DELETE query?"

Teddy continued to remain silent.

"That’s right. INSERT is for new creating new rows or entries in the table. When you withdraw cash, an entry gets made in the transactions table and your photo gets stored in the photos table. Hence two INSERT query gets executed in the process."

"DELETE query is used to delete rows from the table. You can delete only one row or all the rows. Like for example, the hackers could DELETE all their photos …"

Nu became speechless as he queried the photos table. It is now "empty" implying that the hackers have wiped it clean already using the DELETE query. Thankfully, they are a little bit late since Nu has already emailed their photos to the authorities.

As Nu was about to shut down his computer, a tiny message began to appear on the bottom right corner of his screen. It read "Who are you? We are looking for you …"
